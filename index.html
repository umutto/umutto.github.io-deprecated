  <h1>Welcome to my personal page...</h1>
  <p>I'm a software engineer that likes to learn and experiment with state of the art technologies, especially the cool stuff.<br>
    You can learn more <a href=/about>about</a> me, or can see what I'm up to in my <a href=/blog>blog</a> where I intend to talk about projects I am working on (hopefully frequently).
